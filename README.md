# Color Libraries: Pantone

Pantone color libraries as .acb files for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, downloaded with Pantone Color Manager in August 2019. To use the colour libraries, copy the .acb files to the *Color Books* folder of the target application.

## Installation

Copy the files from the given folder structure to the corresponding paths:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may have to adapt the year on all paths as well as your region specific language code on Illustrator!

> [!NOTE]
> You have to open the paths on MacOS manually, since *Go to folderâ€¦* only works for opening the application folder!
